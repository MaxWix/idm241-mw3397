          H2Organizer is a straightforward app that allows the user to
          effectively track water and other drink consumption. My focus with
          this project was on Interaction Design. My goals were two-fold: to
          create a highly intuitive design and create interactions that are
          rewarding to the user and promote further use.

        <!-- <p class="righttext">
          To no surprise, there is a wide variety of water tracker apps in the
          app store. What came as more of a surprise was the lack of good ones.
          I saw overly complicated and thus overwhelming apps. These are
          one-task apps, they should be intuitive and simple. I also saw a lack
          of rewarding visuals and animations; with something so simple there is
          a good opportunity to build polished interactive animations that
          reward the user for using the app.

        <p class="listtitle">What is a Microinteraction?</p>
        <ul class="rightlist">
          <li>Microinteractions are interactive events that involve one purpose and task. They bring engaging and delightful moments to users, humanizing an otherwise very inhuman environment. Microinteractions are bountiful throughout all websites.
</li>

         <p class="listtitle">What makes up a Microinteraction?</p>
        <ol class="rightlist">
          <li>Triggers are what initiate a microinteraction. Examples of triggers could be on-hover, on-click, page-load, on-scroll, etc.
</li>
          <li>Rules determine what happens upon a microinteractions trigger, these rules can provide feedback to the user and/or can be back-end reactions
</li>
          <li>Feedback is what lets the user know about a microinteraction that is happening. It is what the user sees, feels, or hears after triggering a microinteraction.
</li>
          <li>Loops and Modes involve microinteractions that change conditions in an environment, this might involve looping an animation or causing a modal to open.
</li>
        </ol>

         <p class="listtitle">Why are microinteractions important?</p>
        <ul class="rightlist">
          <li>Meaningful microinteractions are essential to the production of a successful digital product. They communicate the happenings and inner workings of a product to the user and humanize the process.</li>

Overall this project was a success. The first indicator of that was the clientâ€™s positive reaction to this project. I managed to design and develop a fully functional recipe website that incorporated the client-provided database and was built to a professional standard. 

This project was also a great personal success. This was my first time using PHP and incorporating SQL databases into my code. I feel that I learned enough to apply this knowledge to all future projects, greatly broadening my skillset in what I can produce. Additionally, I further cemented my skills in HTML, CSS, and JS.
